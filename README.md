sets the value of the instance variable currentWeight to 0.0
sets the value of the instance variable maximumWeight to 5.0
Methods
Name: setName
Access modifier: public
Parameters: newName
Return Type: void
Task: sets the value of the instance variable name to newName
Name: getName
Access modifier: public
Parameters: none
Return Type: String
Task: returns the value of the instance variable name
Name: addItem
Access modifier: public
Parameters: newWeight
Return Type: void
Task: sets the value of the instance variable currentWeight equal to the value of currentWeight plus the
value of newWeight if the value of newWeight is greater than 0 and if the value of currentWeight plus

Return Type: double
Task: returns the value of the instance variable currentWeight
Name: setMaximumWeight
Access modifier: public

newMaximumWeight is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to the value of the instance variable
currentWeight
Name: getMaximumWeight
Access modifier: public
Parameters: none
Return Type: double
Task: returns the value of the instance variable maximumWeight
Step 2
Develop a class with only a main method in it:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class BagDemo {
public static void main(String[] args) {
//Create a Scanner object called keyboard that takes input from
//System.in
//Create an object of the Bag class refer to this object as myBag
//declare a variable called option of type int
//Open a do/while loop
//Prompt the user to pick one of the following options:
//Press 1 to change the name of the bag
//Press 2 to add an item to the bag
//Press 3 to change the maximum weight of the bag
//Press 4 to view all information about the bag
//Press 5 to end the program
//Save the userâ€™s input into the option variable
//if the user picks option 1, prompt the user for the name of the bag
//then save the name of the bag in a variable called newName
//change the name of the bag to newName
//else if the user picks option 2, prompt the user for the weight
//of the item and then save the weight of the item in a variable
//called newWeight
//add the new item to the bag
//else if the user picks option 3, prompt the user for the new maximum
//weight of the bag and save the new maximum weight in a variable
//called newMaximumWeight
//change the maximum weight of the bag to newMaximumWeight
//else if the user picks option 4, display to the screen the name of
//the bag, the current weight of the bag, and the maximum weight
//of the bag
//else if the user picks option 5, display Goodbye.
//else if the user picks any other option, display Error!
//close the do/while loop and make it so that it continues to run as
//long as the user does not pick option 5
}
}
